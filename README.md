# ft_ssl_des

This is the first project in the Encryption and Security branch at Ecole 42. 
The branch focuses on Public-Key Infrastructure using symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing (one-way) algorithms.
This project tackles the symmetric algorithm portion, recoding the DES family of functions.
All of the commands implemented are listed below.
